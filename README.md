HyperMap (obsolete)
========

**This project is dead. Another (hopefully better) attempt at fulfilling the goals of this project can be found at http://github.com/AaronTorgerson/Resourceful**

Fluently map your .NET model classes to REST resource representations.

Make your API "100% RESTful" with 
* hypermedia links (haters gonna HATEOAS), 
* neat URIs, 
* resource representations that allow you to limit the amount of data returned in responses.
